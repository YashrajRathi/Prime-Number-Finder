# Prime-Number-Finder

## About : 
An infinite prime number finder that uses ExecutorService from Java and stores in the file system with proper nomenclature . It uses 3 different ways to find prime numbers in the most efficient based on the range of the prime numbers. It uses a thread pool of 5 in order to optimise over general cores of mt desktop.


## Motivation behind project : 
This was a simple project that I did in the earlier years of my learning curve for programming but after getting informed about core OS concepts like multi threading I wanted to prove my multithreading concepts with a simple project. Hence I used an ExecutorsService in java to calculate prime numbers till infinite if given time. Although the speed significantly decreases after I use BigInteger from Java but that can be attributed to the extra complexity added by newer complex classes. Even though it's not quite difficult to pinpoint the source of deceleration of the problem but it would take a lot of effort.
